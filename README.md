# Tempreture-Sensor-PT100-and-Java
This project will focus on building a functuning Tempreture sensor using a PT100, java and a raspberry pi.

This file will be updated as the project progresses. The files for this project are in the following branches:

1. Circuit design 
2. Java application
3. Enbed into Raspberry pi
4. Write HTML to display Tempretures


Circuit design has all of the files for the circuit used in this project. Currently it contains:
1. Basic ciruit diagram.

Java application has the current version of the Java code. Currently it cointains:
